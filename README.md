## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ocki982/color-me-up-client.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd color-me-up-client
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install --force
```
Must force install to get working with old dependencies, thats due an old Threejs package so it renders the background of the app, might throw errors if not

Start the client

```bash
  npm start
```

Also the client must be working at pair with the server, might deploy the whole app on a website in a future version!
